# encrypt-decrypt
Python program to encrypt a message and create a file and decrypt messages by a file.

Just made this program in less than an hour as a little challenge to refresh some python programming.
I used the package pyAesCrypt to do the encryption and decryption easily, check it out here! https://pypi.org/project/pyAesCrypt/
